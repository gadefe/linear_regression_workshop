## Regression
Definition. Regression is a statistical tool that utilizes the relation
between two or more quantitative variables so that one variable
can be predicted from the other(s)

## Two types of Variables

-variable we want to predict
## 2. Independent variable
-explanatory variable, predictor variable, regressor
-the variable(s) used to predict the value of the dependent variable.


Consider: Heights and Weights of Seven People

Given a person’s height, can we
predict the person’s weight?

How can we best describe the
relationship between height and
weight?

1 68 155
2 61 99
3 63 115
4 70 190
5 69 170
