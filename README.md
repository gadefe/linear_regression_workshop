This a simple linear regression using R programming

## Regression
Definition. Regression is a statistical tool that utilizes the relation
between two or more quantitative variables so that one variable
can be predicted from the other(s)

## Two types of Variables
## 1. Dependent variable
- response variable, outcome
- variable we want to predict
## 2. Independent variable
- explanatory variable, predictor variable, regressor
- the variable(s) used to predict the value of the dependent variable.

Example of Hypothesis
- Advertising expendetures predict quarterly sales.
- Number of dependents predicts employee prescription drug expenses.
- Apartment size predicts montnly rent.
- Number of dinners predict business lunch expense.
- Assembly line speed predicts number of product defects.

More specific form
- How much extra sales will be genrated, on average, by a 1 million increase in advertising expendetures?
  What would expected sales be with no advertising?
  
- How much do prescription drug cost per employee rise, on average, with each extra dependent?
  What would be the expected cost if the employee had no dependents?
  
- How much extra rent, on average, is paid per extra square foot?

- How much extra luncheon cost, on average, is generated by each additional members of the group?
  How much could be saved by restricting lucheon groups to three person?
  
- If the assembly line speed is increase by 20 units per hour, what would happend to the mean number of product defects?
  
 

Consider: Heights and Weights of Seven People

Given a person’s height, can we
predict the person’s weight?

How can we best describe the
relationship between height and
weight?


Subject Height
(inches)
Weight (lbs)
1 68 155
2 61 99
3 63 115
4 70 190
5 69 170
6 65 125
7 72 18
